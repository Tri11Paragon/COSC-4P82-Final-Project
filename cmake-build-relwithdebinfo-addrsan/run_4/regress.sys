building function set(s):
    set 0: * / + - exp log area perimeter major minor eccentricity convex extent R
    tree 0 uses function set 0.
    function set complete.
    no random number seed specfied; using 1.
creating initial population(s):
    1108 trees were generated to fill the population of 800 (800 trees).
    initial population(s) complete.
