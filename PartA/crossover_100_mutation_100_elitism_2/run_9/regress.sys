updating function set(s):
    set 0: removed.
building function set(s):
    set 0: * / + - sin cos exp log x R
    tree 0 uses function set 0.
    function set complete.
    no random number seed specfied; using 1467.
creating initial population(s):
    5600 trees were generated to fill the population of 5000 (5000 trees).
    initial population(s) complete.
